Mind Wurld Open
===============

A port of Apex Open Wurld, as demoed at Kscope15, to Node.

That's telekinesis, Kyle.

Instructions
------------

To get started;

* Make sure you've got Node.js installed, plus as the Express and Body Parser modules.
* Start up the server with "node app.js" from the command line.
* Connect to "http://localhost:4004/"
* Wait for stuff to load
* Hit a key, click the mouse, or press a button on your gamepad
* Walk with W and S, or gamepad Left Stick
* Turn with A and D, or gamepad Right Stick
* Turn music on/off by clicking the icon, hitting the M key, or gamepad Triangle (Y on XBox)
* Switch skins with Left / Right cursor keys, or gamepad d-pad Left / right

You can walk around and marvel at the glitchy physics. But don't go too far, only a small section of the map has been ported to static json files.

Tested on a MacBook Pro Retina, with a PS4 Dualshock controller. A Digital Storm custom gaming PC, with XBox One controller, and an Alienware Alpha with XBox 360 controller.

YMMV
